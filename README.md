# Brooklyn Housing prices model

Assuming I am a data scientist working on behalf of a New York realtors association and have been asked to determine how Brooklyn home purchase prices changed between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020.  Answering that question, making reference to the linear model created using regression techniques.

## Data
Real estate purchases within the borough of Brooklyn from 2016-2020, provided by the City of New York.  For the purposes of this analysis, we will only consider purchases of single-family residences and single-unit apartments or condos.
